title: About
---

I am a software engineer who is passionate about building high quality systems,
tools, and applications. I am continually striving for the feeling of having
built something I'm proud of, something I know that I didn't take shortcuts on,
and something worth sharing. I also have a deep appreciation for modern design
aesthetics and robust interaction design. The melding of form and function is
my holy grail.

When I'm not at a keyboard you can find me down on the dance floor bouncing
around to, or [even spinning](https://soundcloud.com/evanpurkhiser), some of my
favorite genres of music: [UK Hardcore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f74_RDPnaOE)
and [Uplifting Trance](https://soundcloud.com/evanpurkhiser/purkhiser-promo-2020).
Of course, outside of dancing you'll find me at the gym, spending time with my
friends, or getting excited about my next trip.
